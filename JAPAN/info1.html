        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">In 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the "Black Ships" of the United States Navy forced the
            opening of Japan
            to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western
            countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shōgun led to the Boshin War and
            the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).
            Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council,
            introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji era (1868–1912),
            the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that
            pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First
            Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea
            and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70
            million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.

            The early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism
            and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to
            capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism,
            a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political
            dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a
            number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to
            expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of
            the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the
            Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.
            The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War
            (1937–1945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil
            embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl
            Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War
            II in the Pacific. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed
            against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[After Allied victories during the next
            four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
            Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan its colonies and
            millions of lives. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from
            their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its
            influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal
            for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.

            In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied
            occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the
            United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy
            in the world; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the
            "Lost Decade". On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history,
            triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of
            Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.

        </div>
        <div class="c2">
            <p>Japan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000 km (1900
                mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The country's five main
                islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands,
                which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the
                main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019,
                Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the
                world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest
                Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).

                Because of its mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is uninhabitable. The
                habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the
                most densely populated countries. As of 2014, approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is
                reclaimed land (umetatechi).

                Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the
                Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World
                Risk Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami,
                occur several times each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More
                recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which
                triggered a large tsunami.
                The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost
                region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers.
                Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.

                In the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during
                winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the
                foehn.The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature
                differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto
                Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.

                The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional
                snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands
                have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially
                during the rainy season. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front
                gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According
                to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the
                agricultural industry and elsewhere. The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 °C (106.0
                °F), was recorded on July 23, 2018, and repeated on August 17, 2020.

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo
            are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum. Baseball is the most popular
            spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was
            established in 1936. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992,
            association football has gained a wide following. The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with
            South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four
            times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.

            In motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with
            titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World
            Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA
            SportsCar Championship. Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One,
            and drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to
            success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while
            Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series. The country hosts major races such as the
            Japanese Grand Prix.

            Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in
            1998. The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship and will co-host the 2023
            Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first
            Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's
            Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most
            successful Asian Rugby Union country and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.</p>

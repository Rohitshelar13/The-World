        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">After the transition to democracy, Portugal bounced between socialism and adherence to the
            neoliberal model. Land reform and nationalizations were enforced; the Portuguese Constitution (approved in
            1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional
            revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the
            rights of workers, and the desirability of a socialist economy. Portugal's economic situation after the
            revolution obliged the government to pursue International Monetary Fund (IMF)-monitored stabilization
            programs in 1977–78 and 1983–85.

            In 1986, Portugal, along with Spain, joined the European Economic Community (EEC) that later became the
            European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU
            structural and cohesion funds and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.

            Portugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, Macau, was peacefully handed over to the People's
            Republic of China (PRC) on 20 December 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's
            handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of East Timor (Asia) was formally recognized by
            Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation
            Revolution, but interrupted by an Indonesian armed invasion and occupation.
            On 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement Schengen Area rules, eliminating border controls with other
            Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the
            country was a co-founder of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon.
            In 1996, Jorge Sampaio became president. He won re-election in January 2001. Expo '98 took place in Portugal
            and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the euro and the eurozone. On 5 July 2004, José Manuel
            Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal, was nominated President of the European Commission, the most
            powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, after it
            had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the Jerónimos Monastery, in
            Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its
            action. The Republic of Ireland was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
            It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.

            Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the financial crisis of 2007–2008
            led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the European Financial
            Stability Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a loan to help the country
            stabilize its finances.

        <div class="c2">
            <p class="p-2">
                The territory of Portugal includes an area on the Iberian Peninsula (referred to as the continent by
                most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.
                It lies between latitudes 30° and 42° N, and longitudes 32° and 6° W.

                Mainland Portugal is split by its main river, the Tagus, that flows from Spain and disgorges in the
                Tagus Estuary, in Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous
                towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the
                Algarve and the Alentejo regions, is characterized by rolling plains.

                Portugal's highest peak is the similarly named Mount Pico on the island of Pico in the Azores. This
                ancient volcano, which measures 2,351 m (7,713 ft) is an iconic symbol of the Azores, while the Serra da
                Estrela on the mainland (the summit being 1,991 m (6,532 ft) above sea level) is an important seasonal
                attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts.

                The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores
                straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by
                in-plate hotspot geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The
                last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 (Capelinhos) and minor earthquakes occur
                sporadically, usually of low intensity.

                Portugal's exclusive economic zone, a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the
                exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408 km2. This is the 3rd largest exclusive economic
                zone of the European Union and the 20th largest in the world.
                Portugal is mainly characterized by a Mediterranean climate (Csa in the South, central interior, and the
                Douro river valley; Csb in the North, Central west and Vicentine Coast), temperate maritime climate
                (Cfb) in the mainland north-western highlands and mountains, and in some high altitude zones of the
                Azorean islands; a semi-arid climate in certain parts of the Beja District far south (BSk) and in Porto
                Santo Island (BSh), a warm desert climate (BWh) in the Selvagens Islands and a humid subtropical climate
                in the western Azores (Cfa), according to the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification. It is one of the
                warmest countries in Europe: the annual average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from 10–12 °C
                (50.0–53.6 °F) in the mountainous interior north to 16–18 °C (60.8–64.4 °F) in the south and on the
                Guadiana river basin. There are however, variations from the highlands to the lowlands: Spanish
                biologist Salvador Rivas Martinez presents several different bioclimatic zones for Portugal. The
                Algarve, separated from the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to 900 metres (3,000 ft) in Alto da
                Fóia, has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.

                Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over 3,200 mm (126.0 in) on the Peneda-Gerês
                National Park to less than 500 mm (19.7 in) in southern parts of Alentejo. Mount Pico is recognized as
                receiving the largest annual rainfall (over 6,250 mm (246.1 in) per year) in Portugal, according to
                Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera.

                In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual diurnal average temperatures can be as high as 26 °C
                (79 °F), and summer's highest temperatures are routinely over 40 °C (104 °F). The record high of 47.4 °C
                (117.3 °F) was recorded in Amareleja, although this might not be the hottest spot in summer, according
                to satellite readings.

        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that
            have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role
            during the Age of Discovery. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Portugal modernized its public cultural
            facilities, in addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon.

            These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música, both in
            Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built
            or renovated in many municipalities across the country. Portugal is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites,
            ranking it 9th in Europe and 18th in the world.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Football is the most popular sport in Portugal. There are several football competitions ranging
            from local amateur to world-class professional level. The legendary Eusébio is still a major symbol of
            Portuguese football history. FIFA World Player of the Year winners Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo, who won
            the FIFA Ballon d'Or, are two world-class Portuguese football players. Portuguese football managers are also
            noteworthy, with José Mourinho being among the most renowned.

            The Portugal national football team – Seleção Nacional – have won one UEFA European Championship title: the
            UEFA Euro 2016, with a 1–0 victory in the final over France, the tournament hosts. In addition, Portugal
            finished first in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League with a 1–0 win over the Netherlands in the final (held in
            Portugal), second in the Euro 2004 (also held in Portugal), third in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and 2017 FIFA
            Confederations Cup, and fourth in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At youth level, Portugal have won two FIFA World
            Youth Championships (in 1989 and 1991) and several UEFA European Youth Championships.

            S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP and FC Porto are the largest sports clubs by popularity and by number of trophies
            won, often known as "os três grandes" ("the big three"). They have won eight titles in the European UEFA
            club competitions, were present in 21 finals and have been regular contenders in the last stages almost
            every season. Other than football, many Portuguese sports clubs, including the "big three", compete in
            several other sports events with a varying level of success and popularity, these may include roller hockey,
            basketball, futsal, handball, and volleyball. The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) – Federação
            Portuguesa de Futebol – annually hosts the Algarve Cup, a prestigious women's football tournament that has
            been celebrated in the Algarvian part of Portugal.

            The Portuguese national rugby union team qualified for the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the Portuguese national
            rugby sevens team has played in the World Rugby Sevens Series.In athletics, the Portuguese have won a number
            of gold, silver and bronze medals in the European, World and Olympic Games competitions. Cycling, with Volta
            a Portugal being the most important race, is also a popular sports event and includes professional cycling
            teams such as Sporting CP, Boavista, Clube de Ciclismo de Tavira and União Ciclista da Maia. At
            international level, Portuguese cyclists have already achieved good results. Joaquim Agostinho finished on
            the podium in 1978 and 1979 Tour de France, and 1974 Vuelta a España. Rui Costa has won the world title in
            the men's road race.

            The country has also achieved notable performances in sports like fencing, judo, kitesurf, rowing, sailing,
            surfing, shooting, taekwondo, triathlon and windsurf, owning several European and world titles. The
            paralympic athletes have also conquered many medals in sports like swimming, boccia, athletics, mixed
            martial arts and wrestling.

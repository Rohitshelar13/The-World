        <p>
            On 15 August 1947, India peacefully became free and independent from the British Empire. India's
            constitution was founded on 26 January 1950. Every year, on this day, Indians celebrate Republic Day. The
            first official leader (Prime Minister) of India was Jawaharlal Nehru.After 1947, India had a socialist
            planned economy. It is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations. It
            has fought many wars since independence from Britain, including the wars in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999
            with Pakistan and in 1962 with China. It also fought a war to capture Goa, a Portuguese-built port and a
            city which was not a part of India until 1961. The Portuguese refused to give it to the country, and so
            India had to use force and the Portuguese were defeated. India has also done nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998,
            and it is one of the few countries that has nuclear bombs. Since 1991, India has been one of the
            fastest-growing economies in the world.

            <h3 class="mt-2">Geography & Climate</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="c2">
            <p class="p-2">Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe; bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and
                the Czech
                Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France,
                Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also
                bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers
                357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 348,672 km2 (134,623 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq
                mi) of water.

                Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721
                feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee)
                in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest
                point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea
                level) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural
                resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and
                nickel
                Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north to continental in the east
                and
                southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to mild and are generally overcast with
                limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions
                have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature
                and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.

                From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F)
                in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019. Average monthly precipitation ranged
                from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February
                2020. Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.
                The highest temperature ever recorded in Germany was 42.6 °C on 25 July 2019 in Lingen and the lowest
                was −37.8 °C on 12 February 1929 in Wolnzach.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Culture</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe,
            both religious
            and secular. Historically, Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker ("the land of poets and
            thinkers"), because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played in the development of
            Western thought. A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the
            most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.

            Germany is well known for such folk festival traditions as Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include
            Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices. As of
            2016 UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List. There are a number of public
            holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990,
            celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day)</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football
            Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide, and the German
            top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports
            leagues in the world. The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974,
            1990, and 2014, the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996, and the FIFA Confederations
            Cup in 2017.

            Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are
            prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13
            times (as of 2017). The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career,
            having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships. Sebastian Vettel is also among the top five
            most successful Formula One drivers of all time.

            Historically, German athletes have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an
            all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals). Germany was the last
            country to host both the summer and winter games in the same year, in 1936: the Berlin Summer Games and the
            Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">New Zealand is one of the last major landmasses settled by humans. Radiocarbon dating, evidence
            of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest that Eastern
            Polynesians first settled the New Zealand archipelago between 1250 and 1300, although newer
            archaeological and genetic research points to a date no earlier than about 1280, with at least the main
            settlement period between about 1320 and 1350, consistent with evidence based on genealogical
            traditions. This represented a culmination in a long series of voyages through the Pacific
            islands. Over the centuries that followed, the Polynesian settlers developed a distinct culture now
            known as Māori. The population formed different iwi (tribes) and hapū (subtribes) which would sometimes
            cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other. At some point, a group of Māori
            migrated to Rēkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori
            culture. The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862, largely because of
            Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed. In 1862,
            only 101 survived, and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933.
            Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs, fighting in the first and Second World
            Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to the election of the first
            Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy.
            New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War, and Māori began to leave
            their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A Māori protest movement
            developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the
            Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the
            Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated
            settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed proved
            controversial in the 2000s

            <h3 class="mt-2">Geography & Climate</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="c2">
            <p>New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a
                number of smaller islands. The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South
                Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest
                point.Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island
                (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),D'Urville
                Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland).
                New Zealand is long and narrow—over 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) along its north-north-east axis with a
                maximum width of 400 kilometres (250 mi)—with about 15,000 km (9,300 mi) of coastline and a
                total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi). Because of its far-flung outlying
                islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. Its exclusive economic zone is
                one of the largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area.
                New Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb), with mean annual temperatures
                ranging from 10 °C (50 °F) in the south to 16 °C (61 °F) in the north. Historical maxima and minima
                are 42.4 °C (108.32 °F) in Rangiora, Canterbury and −25.6 °C (−14.08 °F) in Ranfurly, Otago.
                Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to
                semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury, and subtropical in
                Northland. Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only
                618 millimetres (24.3 in) of rain per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that
                amount. Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours
                of sunshine. The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate,
                with around 1,400–1,600 hours; the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest
                areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours. The general snow season is early June
                until early October, though cold snaps can occur outside this season. Snowfall is common in the
                eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country.

            <h3 class="mt-2">Culture</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges
            associated with
            a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social
            organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief
            (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants
            brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,
            particularly with the introduction of Christianity.[308] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to
            tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian
            peoples. More recently, American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence
            on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest
            Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.

            The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious
            problem solvers. Modesty was expected and enforced through the "tall poppy syndrome", where high
            achievers received harsh criticism. At the time, New Zealand was not known as an intellectual
            country. From the early 20th century until the late 1960s, Māori culture was suppressed by the
            attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders. In the 1960s, as tertiary education became
            more available, and cities expanded urban culture began to dominate. However, rural imagery and
            themes are common in New Zealand's art, literature and media.

            New Zealand's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Māori sources. The silver fern is
            an emblem appearing on army insignia and sporting team uniforms. Certain items of popular culture
            thought to be unique to New Zealand are called "Kiwiana"</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins. Rugby union is
            considered the national sport and attracts the most spectators. Golf, netball, tennis and cricket
            have the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union and football (soccer) are
            particularly popular among young people. Horse racing is one of the most popular spectator sports
            in New Zealand and was part of the "rugby, racing, and beer" subculture during the 1960s. Around 54% of
            New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their school.Victorious rugby tours to Australia and
            the United Kingdom in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a national
            identity. Māori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby, and the country's
            team performs a haka, a traditional Māori challenge, before international matches. New Zealand is known
            for its extreme sports, adventure tourism and strong mountaineering tradition, as seen in the success
            of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary. Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling, fishing,
            swimming, running, tramping, canoeing, hunting, snowsports, surfing and sailing are also popular. New
            Zealand has seen regular sailing success in the America's Cup regatta since 1995. The Polynesian sport
            of waka ama racing has experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s.

            New Zealand has competitive international teams in rugby union, rugby league, netball, cricket, softball,
            and sailing. New Zealand participated at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1912 as a joint team with
            Australia, before first participating on its own in 1920. The country has ranked highly on a
            medals-to-population ratio at recent Games. The "All Blacks", the national rugby union team, are
            the most successful in the history of international rugby and have won the World Cup three times.</p>

        <p class="p-2">
            England was named after a Germanic tribe called the "Angles", who settled in Central, Northern, and Eastern
            England in the 5th and 6th centuries. A related tribe called the "Saxons" settled in the south of England.
            That is why that period of English history is called "Anglo-Saxon". For most of this time, England did not
            exist as a united country. The Anglo-Saxons lived in many small kingdoms, which slowly united.The United
            Kingdom was formed in 1800, when the Irish Parliament merged with the British one. later on, many in Ireland
            fought against this merger. The result was the separation of the Republic of Ireland. This is not the whole
            island of Ireland. The rest of the island, Northern Ireland, is now the only part of Ireland still in the
            UK. England is the only country of UK not to have its own government, Parliament or Assembly, but is
            governed by Parliament of the United Kingdom. Seats in Parliament are decided by the number of electors in
            the various parts of the UK.

        </div>
        <div class="c2 p-2">
            <p> All of Great Britain has an oceanic climate. There can be a temperature difference of 5–10°c between the
                north and the south (the north is generally colder), and there is often snow in the north before there
                is in the south.

                The prevailing wind for most of the year is from the Atlantic, to the west of England. Therefore, there
                is more rain on the western side of the country. The east is colder and drier than the west. The country
                usually has a mild climate because the Gulf Stream to the western side is warm water. The climate is
                warmer than it was 200 years ago, and now ice and snow are rare in the southern part of the country.
                Occasionally, air from the Arctic Circle comes down the eastern side of the country and the temperature
                can drop below 0<sup>o</sup>C
                Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus
                such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly. It is bordered by two other
                countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. England is closer
                than any other part of mainland Britain to the European continent. It is separated from France
                (Hauts-de-France) by a 21-mile (34 km) sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the
                Channel Tunnel near Folkestone.England also has shores on the Irish Sea, North Sea and Atlantic
                Ocean.</p>

            <p> Prominent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Michael
                Faraday, Charles Darwin, Robert Hooke, James Prescott Joule, John Dalton, Lord Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson,
                James Chadwick, Charles Babbage, George Boole, Alan Turing, Tim Berners-Lee, Paul Dirac, Stephen
                Hawking, Peter Higgs, Roger Penrose, John Horton Conway, Thomas Bayes, Arthur Cayley, G. H. Hardy,
                Oliver Heaviside, Andrew Wiles, Edward Jenner, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Joseph Priestley, Thomas
                Young, Christopher Wren and Richard Dawkins. Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric
                system was invented by John Wilkins, the first secretary of the Royal Society, in 1668.

                England was a leading centre of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century. As the birthplace
                of the Industrial Revolution, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and
                early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, best known for the
                creation of the Great Western Railway, a series of famous steamships, and numerous important bridges,
                hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering. Thomas Newcomen's steam engine
                helped spawn the Industrial Revolution.

                The Father of Railways, George Stephenson, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world,
                the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and
                manufacturing of the steam engine, and invention of modern coinage, Matthew Boulton (business partner of
                James Watt) is regarded as one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history.The physician
                Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine is said to have "saved more lives ... than were lost in all the wars of
                mankind since the beginning of recorded history."</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p> England has a strong sporting heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played
            around the world. Sports originating in England include association football, cricket, rugby union,
            rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, rounders, hockey, snooker, billiards, darts,
            table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting. It has helped the
            development of golf, sailing and Formula One.

            Football is the most popular of these sports. The England national football team, whose home venue is
            Wembley Stadium, played Scotland in the first ever international football match in 1872. Referred to as
            the "home of football" by FIFA, England hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and won the tournament by defeating
            West Germany 4–2 in the final, with Geoff Hurst scoring a hat-trick. With a British television audience
            peak of 32.30 million viewers, the final is the most watched television event ever in the UK.
            At club level, England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, due to Sheffield F.C.
            founded in 1857 being the world's oldest club. The Football Association is the oldest governing body in
            the sport, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.The FA Cup and The
            Football League were the first cup and league competitions respectively. In the modern day, the Premier
            League is the world's most-watched football league, most lucrative, and amongst the elite.
            Cricket is generally thought to have been developed in the early medieval period among the farming and
            metalworking communities of the Weald. The England cricket team is a composite England and Wales, team.
            One of the game's top rivalries is The Ashes series between England and Australia, contested since 1882. The
            climax of the 2005 Ashes was viewed by 7.4 million as it was available on terrestrial television.
            England has hosted five Cricket World Cups (1975, 1979, 1983, 1999 and 2019), winning the 2019 edition in a
            final regarded as one of the greatest one day internationals ever played. They hosted the ICC World
            Twenty20 in 2009, winning this format in 2010 beating rivals Australia in the final. In the domestic
            competition, the County Championship, Yorkshire are by far the most successful club having won the
            competition 32 times outright and sharing it on 1 other occasion. Lord's Cricket Ground situated in
            London is sometimes referred to as the "Mecca of Cricket"</p>

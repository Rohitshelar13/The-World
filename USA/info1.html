        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it
            joined the war as an "associated power" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide
            against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris
            Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate
            refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of
            Nations.

            In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's
            suffrage. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early
            television. The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the
            onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with
            the New Deal. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began
            before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished
            many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.
            After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for power, influence, and prestige
            during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and
            communism. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side
            and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment
            towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and
            developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.

            The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored and occasionally
            pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments, occasionally supporting authoritarian
            right-wing regimes. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War
            of 1950–1953. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of
            the first crewed spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States became the first nation to
            land a man on the Moon in 1969. The United States became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War
            (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965.

            At home, the U.S. had experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and
            middle class following World War II. After a surge in female labor participation, especially in the 1970s,
            by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed. Construction of an Interstate Highway
            System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and
            inner cities to large suburban housing developments. In 1959, the United States formally expanded
            beyond the contiguous United States when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii became, respectively, the 49th
            and 50th states admitted into the Union. The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront
            segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead.
            A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end
            racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by
            opposition to the Vietnam war, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution.

                The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles
                (8,080,470 km2). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km2) is contiguous land, composing
                83.65% of total U.S. land area. Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific,
                southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The five populated but
                unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S.
                Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2). Measured by only land area, the
                United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.

                The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking
                behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories
                disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is
                measured.

                The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling
                hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes
                and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river
                system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great
                Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.

                The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking around
                14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the
                Chihuahua and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast,
                both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the
                contiguous United States are in the state of California, and only about 84 miles (135 km)
                apart. At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the
                country and in North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and
                Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone
                National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.

                The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east
                of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in
                the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains
                have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean
                in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska
                is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories
                in the Caribbean and the Pacific. States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and
                most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and
                South. Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any
                other country in the world.

            <h3 class="mt-2">Culture</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and
            values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly
            all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture
            is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many
            other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia
            and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing
            melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive
            cultural characteristics.

            Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and
            individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality,
            private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government. Americans are
            extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to
            charity, more than any other nation studied.

            The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in
            attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.
            While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify
            significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and
            values. Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is
            also generally seen as a positive attribute.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United
            States; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in
            the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally. Even on the collegiate level,
            college football games receive millions of viewers per television broadcast; most notably the College
            Football Playoff, which averages 25 million viewers. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national
            sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice
            hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National
            Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). College football and basketball
            attract large audiences. The NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched sporting events. In soccer (a
            sport that has gained a footing in the United States since the mid-1990s), the country hosted the 1994 FIFA
            World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA
            Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States
            (featuring 23 American and three Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United
            States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
            combined.

            Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri,
            were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe. As of 2017, the United States has won 2,522
            medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the
            second most behind Norway. While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have
            evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American
            inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native
            American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. The most-watched individual
            sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.</p>

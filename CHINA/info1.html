        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">
            On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or
            Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president. On 12 February 1912, regent Empress Dowager
            Longyu sealed the imperial abdication decree on behalf of 4 year old Puyi, the last emperor of China, ending
            5,000 years of monarchy in China. In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing
            general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition
            from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916.

            After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was
            internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its
            territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under Chiang Kai-shek, the then Principal of the
            Republic of China Military Academy, was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of
            deft military and political manoeuvrings, known collectively as the Northern Expedition. The
            Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage
            of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's San-min program for transforming China into a modern
            democratic state. The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the
            communist People's Liberation Army (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the
            Chinese Civil War. This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in
            the Long March, until Japanese aggression and the 1936 Xi'an Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial
            Japan.


            Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong toasting together in 1946 following the end of World War II
            The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the
            Kuomintang and the PLA. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population;
            in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were
            massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation. During the war, China, along with
            the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as "trusteeship of the powerful" and
            were recognized as the Allied "Big Four" in the Declaration by United Nations. Along with the other
            three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of
            the primary victors in the war.[ After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the
            Pescadores, was returned to Chinese control. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially
            drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil
            war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the
            ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.

        </div>
        <div class="c2 p-2">
            <p class="p-2"> China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the
                arid north to
                the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain
                ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and
                sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern
                seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the
                Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian
                Steppe which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the
                Steppe route – the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road</p>
            <p>
                The territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E. The
                geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35°50′40.9″N
                103°27′7.5″E. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the
                shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial
                plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate.
                Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of
                China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi,
                Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High
                plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi
                Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.[134] The
                country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154 m) in
                the Turpan Depression.</p>

            <p>The National Health and Family Planning Commission, together with its counterparts in the local
                commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population. An emphasis on public health and
                preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the
                Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and
                hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and
                scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[citation
                needed] After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public
                improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided
                in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly
                privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year
                large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion. By 2011, the campaign resulted in
                95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage. In 2011, China was estimated to
                be the world's third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals, but its population has suffered from the
                development and distribution of counterfeit medications.

                As of 2017, the average life expectancy at birth in China is 76 years, and the infant mortality
                rate is 7 per thousand. Both have improved significantly since the 1950s. Rates of stunting, a
                condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010. Despite
                significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has
                several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air
                pollution, hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers, and an increase in obesity among urban
                youths. China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease
                outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS, although this has since been largely
                contained. In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.

                The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019. Despite this, there is
                no convincing scientific evidence on the virus's origin, and further studies are being carried out
                around the world on a possible origin for the virus.The Chinese government has been
                criticized for its handling of the epidemic and accused of concealing the extent of the outbreak before
                it became an international pandemic. </p>

        <p class="p-2">China has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world. There is evidence that archery
            (shèjiàn) was
            practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (jiànshù) and cuju, a sport loosely related to
            association football date back to China's early dynasties as well.
            Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and t'ai chi
            ch'uan widely practiced, and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity across
            the country. Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China. The Chinese
            Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association have a huge following among the
            people, with native or ethnic Chinese players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian held in high esteem.
            China's professional football league, now known as Chinese Super League, was established in 1994, it is the
            largest football market in Asia. Other popular sports in the country include martial arts, table
            tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. Board games such as go (known as wéiqí in Chinese), xiangqi,
            mahjong, and more recently chess, are also played at a professional level. In addition, China is home
            to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012. Many more traditional
            sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.

            China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since
            1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 51 gold medals – the
            highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year.[619] China also won the most medals of
            any nation at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold medals.[620][621] In 2011,
            Shenzhen in Guangdong, China hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade. China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in
            Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing; the first country to host both regular and Youth
            Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou of Hebei province will also collaboratively host the 2022
            Olympic Winter Games, which will make Beijing the first city in the world to hold both the Summer Olympics
            and the Winter Olympics.</p>

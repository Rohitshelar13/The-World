        <p>
            On 15 August 1947, India peacefully became free and independent from the British Empire. India's
            constitution was founded on 26 January 1950. Every year, on this day, Indians celebrate Republic Day. The
            first official leader (Prime Minister) of India was Jawaharlal Nehru.After 1947, India had a socialist
            planned economy. It is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations. It
            has fought many wars since independence from Britain, including the wars in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999
            with Pakistan and in 1962 with China. It also fought a war to capture Goa, a Portuguese-built port and a
            city which was not a part of India until 1961. The Portuguese refused to give it to the country, and so
            India had to use force and the Portuguese were defeated. India has also done nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998,
            and it is one of the few countries that has nuclear bombs. Since 1991, India has been one of the
            fastest-growing economies in the world.

            <h3 class="mt-2">Geography & Climate</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="c2">
            <p> India is the seventh biggest country in the world. It is the main part of the Indian subcontinent. The
                countries next to India are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Bhutan, and Nepal. It is also near Sri
                Lanka, an island country.

                India is a peninsula, which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water. One of the seven
                wonders of
                the world is in Agra: the Taj Mahal. In the west is the Arabian Sea, in the south is the Indian Ocean,
                and
                in the east is the Bay of Bengal. The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous
                mountain
                range in India is the Himalayas, which have some of the tallest mountains in the world. There are many
                rivers in India. The main rivers are the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Yamuna, the Godavari, the Kaveri,
                the
                Narmada, and the Krishna.

                India has different climates. In the South, the climate is mainly tropical, which means it can get very
                hot in summer and cool in winter. The northern part, though, has a cooler climate, called sub-tropical,
                and even alpine in mountainous regions.The Himalayas, in the alpine climate region, can get extremely
                cold. There is very heavy rainfall along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The
                west,
                though, is drier. Because of some of the deserts of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the
                year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the
                Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so
                heavily,
                droughts (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible. Monsoons normally come
                around
                July - August.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Culture</h3>
        </div>
        <p> Several modern religions are linked to India, namely modern Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.
            All of these religions have different schools (ways of thinking) and traditions that are related. As a
            group they are called the Eastern religions. The Indian religions are similar to one another in many
            ways: The basic beliefs, the way worship is done and several religious practices are very similar. These
            similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins.
            They also influenced each other.

            The religion of Hinduism is the main faith followed by 79.80% of people in the Republic of India; Islam
            – 14.23%; Christianity – 2.30%; Sikhism – 1.72%; Buddhism – 0.70% and Jainism – 0.37%.

            It's the first time ever since independence that Hindu population percentage fell below 80%.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p> Sports in India refers to the large variety of games played in India, ranging from tribal games to more
            mainstream sports such as field hockey, kabaddi, cricket, badminton and football. India's diversity of
            culture, people, and tribes, as well as its colonial legacy, are reflected in the wide variety of
            sporting disciplines in the country.

            Kabaddi is an ancient sport and the fastest growing sport of India. It can be said that Indian Kabaddi
            team is the strongest kabaddi team in the world and to defeat India is very hard for other countries
            teams. India won many matches and seasons of Kabaddi at the Asian Games and all three seasons of Kabaddi
            World Cup (Standard style). Cricket is the most popular sport in India, the country having hosted and
            won the Cricket World Cup on multiple occasions. Field hockey is the most successful sport for India at
            the Olympic Games; the Indian men's team has won eight Olympic gold medals. Kabaddi is the most popular
            indigenous sport in the country. Other popular sports in India are badminton, football, shooting,
            wrestling, boxing, tennis, squash, weightlifting, gymnastics, athletics, table tennis, basketball,
            volleyball and cycling. Popular indigenous sports include chess, kho-kho, kite-fighting, leg cricket,
            polo, snooker and gillidanda.

            India has hosted and co-hosted several international sporting events, most notably the 1987, 1996 and
            2011 Cricket World Cups, the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2017 FIFA
            U-17 World Cup.

            Domestic professional sports leagues in the country include the Indian Premier League (Twenty20
            cricket), the I-League and the Indian Super League (football), the Pro Kabaddi League (kabaddi), the
            Hockey India League (hockey), Premier Badminton League (badminton), the Pro Wrestling League
            (wrestling), the Ultimate Table Tennis league (table tennis), and the Pro Volleyball League
            (volleyball). The Ultimate Kho-Kho League is expected to launch in 2020, having attracted a major
            sponsorship deal with Dabur.

            Major international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai Open in tennis, the
            Indian Open in golf, and the India Open in badminton.

            The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna is India's highest award for achievement in sports, while the Dronacharya
            Award is awarded for excellence in coaching.</p>

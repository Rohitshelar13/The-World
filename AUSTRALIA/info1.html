        <h3 class="mt-2">History</h3>
        <p class="p-2">
            Until 1901, Australia was not a nation, it was six separate colonies governed by Britain. They voted to join
            together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of
            the British Empire, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its
            own money, and its own Army and Navy.

            In Australia at this time, the trade unions were very strong, and they started a political party, the
            Australian Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the workers.

            In 1914, the First World War started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany,
            Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in the Ottoman Empire.
            They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC
            Day. They also fought on the Western Front. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

            Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against
            Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in
            the Fall of Singapore by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion.
            But with help from the United States Navy, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a
            close friend of the United States.

            When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So
            the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things
            like building the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They
            came especially from Italy and Greece, other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like
            Turkey and Lebanon. An important new party, the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in
            1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party.
            Whitlam made changes, but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor-General sacked him and forced an
            election in 1975. Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">
            In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in
            Asia. Australia became more multicultural. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest
            countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, than Japan.
            Australia supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq.
            Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like East Timor in 1999.

            In 1973, the famous Sydney Opera House opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies, actors
            and singers became famous around the world. In the year 2000, Sydney had the Summer Olympics.

            In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, then the Liberal Party under John
            Howard made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad recession in 1991, but when other Western
            countries had trouble with their economies in 2008, Australia stayed strong.

            Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of
            Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like Uluru) has been returned to
            Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government
            chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia.
            These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or
            because they are refugees. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two,
            including around 660,000 refugees.

            Julia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her colleague
            Kevin Rudd of the Labor Party.

        <h3 class="mt-2">Geography</h3>


        <p class="p-2">Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the Indo-Australian plate.The continent
            of
            Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many
            millions of years ago. Because of this, many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere
            else. These include animals like the kangaroo, the koala, the emu, the kookaburra, and the platypus.

            People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the
            Australian Aborigines. For the history of Australia, see History of Australia.

            Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from Britain, became mostly independent democratic
            states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first Prime Minister of
            Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901. Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of
            Nations. It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II as Queen of
            Australia and Head of State and a Governor-General who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the
            duties of the Queen in Australia.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Culture</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2"> Australia Day and Anzac Day are both Australian holidays. A Barbecue is traditionally eaten on
            those days.
            Australia was colonised by people from Britain, but today people from all over the world live there.
            English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are
            accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is multicultural, which means that all its people are
            encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning English and
            joining in with other Australians.

            Famous Australian writers include the bush balladeers Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson who wrote about life
            in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Colleen
            McCullough. In 1973, Patrick White won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved
            this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

            Australian music has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers Nellie Melba and Joan
            Sutherland, the rock and roll bands Bee Gees, AC/DC and INXS, the folk-rocker Paul Kelly (musician), the pop
            singer Kylie Minogue and Australian country music stars Slim Dusty and John Williamson. Australian
            Aboriginal music is very special and very ancient: it has the famous digeridoo woodwind instrument.

            Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including Skippy the Bush
            Kangaroo, Home and Away and Neighbours - and produced such well known TV stars as Barry Humphries (Dame Edna
            Everage), Steve Irwin (The Crocodile Hunter) and The Wiggles. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan
            have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as Bogan Hunters and Kath & Kim.

            Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television
            networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major
            city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The
            Australian Financial Review.

            Australian movies have a very long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie The
            Story of the Kelly Gang of 1906. In 1933, In the Wake of the Bounty, directed by Charles Chauvel, had
            Errol Flynn as the main actor. Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian
            Oscar was won by 1942's Kokoda Front Line!, directed by Ken G. Hall. In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big
            Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli
            (with Mel Gibson), The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee. Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and
            Heath Ledger became global stars during the 1990s and Australia starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman made
            a lot of money in 2008.

            Australia is also a popular destination for business conferences and research, with Sydney named as one of
            the top 20 meeting destinations in the world</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2">Sports</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p-2">Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5%
            Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities. In international
            sports, Australia has very strong teams in cricket, hockey, netball, rugby league and rugby union, and
            performs well in cycling, rowing and swimming. Local popular sports include Australian Rules Football, horse
            racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games since 1896, and
            every Commonwealth Games. Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and has ranked in the top
            five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games
            and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia
            include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket
            matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and
            elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television
            programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football
            competitions.

            The main sporting leagues for males are the Australian Football League, National Rugby League, A-League and
            NBL. For women, they are ANZ Netball Championships, W-League and WNBL.

            Famous Australian sports players include the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the
            athlete Cathy Freeman. </p>
